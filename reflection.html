  <h1>Lessons Learned Personal Assignment Reflection</h1>
  <h4><u>What went well?</u></h4>
  <p>Some things I thought went really well during this assignment: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I've been able to learn from my mistakes and use the resources such as notes i've taken from class and class recordings to help along the way when I get stuck at something.</li>
    <li>After you do the action a few times it get's so much easier to repeat it. it is something that will need ongoing practice to not lose the groove!</li>
    <li>Dispite some of  the mistakes I made during the assignment I was able to correct them, confirm fixed prior to submitting the assignment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><u>What were some opportunities?</u></h4>
  <p>Some key things I will be taking away from this assignment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Don't rush the actions - Rushing causes error's</li>
    <li> DON'T MAKE MULTIPLE ISSUES AT ONCE (at least for right now anyway).</li>
    <li>Review three times before fully committing a change (make sure there are no additional errors that are there that you will have to fix later.)</li>
    <li> Learning Opportunitie: Ask Professor how to get the branch clone url after you've closed out of the window.</li>
  </ul>
